This is my first personal project using JavaScript.

It was initially meant to be a small project, a basic page that would display the characters and locations from the show "Adventure Time",
As I built it, however, I started to really enjoy building the frontend. I really love the show so I went a little overboard with it.

It ended up taking much longer than anticipated but I'm very happy with the result, and it helped me figure out that the frontend is what I enjoy the most.
